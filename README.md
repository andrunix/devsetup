# devsetup

This repo contains mostly documentation on tools needed to setup a new OS X system for development the way I like it. I'm also including tools for LinuxMint and Ubuntu. Not everything is mandatory. Do what you want. 

## [OSX](osx)


## [LinuxMint](linuxmint)



## [Ubuntu Linux](ubuntu)
